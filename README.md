🧱 Lego Project Portfolio
This project was created as part of my personal portfolio to experiment with stylized shaders inside Unity, using a LEGO-style scene to explore visual effects and technical art workflows.

✨ Key Shader Experiments
⏱️ Clock Shader
A fully shader-based analog clock that calculates hand rotation in real-time.

No scripts involved — all logic is handled within the shader.

🎞️ Stop Motion Animation Shader
Mimics the visual feel of stop-motion animation by updating object poses at fixed intervals.

Useful for creating a handmade, stylized aesthetic.

🛠️ Engine & Tools
Unity (ShaderLab + URP)
